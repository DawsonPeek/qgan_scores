## 🔭 Overview

Generating high-resolution images on quantum computers requires a prohibitive number of qubits ($2^N$). This Bachelor's Thesis project proposes a "Divide and Conquer" solution: the image is divided into patches, each generated by a dedicated quantum circuit, and then reassembled.

### Key Strengths
* **Efficiency:** Generation of $16\times16$ and $32\times32$ images on limited simulators.
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Leverages the power of PyTorch for the discriminator and PennyLane for quantum generators.
* **In-Depth Analysis:** Quantitative evaluation through standard metrics (FID and LPIPS).

## 🛠 Architecture and Technologies

The system integrates classical Deep Learning logic with variational quantum circuits (PQC).

### Quantum Layer (PennyLane)
* **Framework:** PennyLane for circuit simulation.
* **Gradients:** Computation via **Parameter-Shift Rule** for backpropagation in quantum circuits.
* **Circuit:** Rotations and Entanglement.

### Classical Layer (PyTorch)
* **Discriminator:** Classical MLP to classify assembled images.
* **Post-Processing:** Hybrid variants (QGAN-CNN/MLP) to refine quantum output.
* **Optimization:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for joint weight updates.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧩 Patch-based Generation
* **Sub-Generators:** The image is divided into 4 or 8 sub-regions.
* **Parallelism:** Each patch is handled by an independent quantum circuit (6-10 qubits).

### ⚛️ Hybrid Variants
* **QGAN-CNN:** Image refinement through classical convolutional layers.
* **Entanglement:** Support for different entanglement topologies (Fixed vs Parametric).

### 📊 Metrics & Analysis
* **FID (Fréchet Inception Distance):** To evaluate visual quality.
* **LPIPS:** To measure sample diversity (Mode Collapse detection).

---

## 📉 Experimental Results

Tests conducted on the MNIST dataset (digit '0') revealed:

* **16x16 px:** Excellent convergence, especially in variants with classical post-processing.
* **32x32 px:** Complex scalability; evidence of *Mode Collapse* issues (poor diversity of generated images).
